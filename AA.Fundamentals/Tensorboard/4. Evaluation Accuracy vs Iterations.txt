Evaluation Accuracy vs Iterations (evaluation_accuracy_vs_iterations)
What it is: This measures accuracy during model evaluation, plotted against the number of iterations (or batches).
How to interpret: It helps monitor the performance of the model during the evaluation phase. A higher value means better accuracy.
Use case: Helps assess how well the model is performing on validation data during or after training. Itâ€™s useful for checking overfitting or underfitting.
