Epoch Loss (epoch_loss)
What it is: The average loss (error) for your model for each epoch.
How to interpret: A lower loss means your model is better at minimizing the error between its predictions and the true values.
Use case: Tracking whether the models error is decreasing as training progresses. This is a key measure of model performance.
